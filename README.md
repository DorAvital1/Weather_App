# Weather_App
Hello there, I built a weather website, using HTML, CSS and flask - Python web developemnt framework.(Desktop version only - not responsive) This small project taught me how to connect to API using API key, extract data from Json file, transform into information and present it to the user using basic html and design with css.

For your convenience, I pushed the project to a live server ("pythonanywhere" - PaaS) so you can easily access the website from here:
